Monade

An expert system in Python with an implementation in Plone content types
supporting Perspectivism through faceted ontology.

The basic idea is that rules and facts can both be tested as a question
against a context, and each question can decide on its own how to use the
(possibly redundant and/or contradictory) facts and rules it finds.

Origin of the name Monade:

The concept of Monad developed in G. Leibniz Monadology seems to imply a
sort of perspectivism. Monads are the irreducible substances of which all
composite substances are made. I heard them explained first as a concept
which works roughly like cellular automata by Dr. John Kenny at Bradley in
1993. I only just discovered some of his writing archived at UIUC, which
probably covers some of that. It was in this context that I approached
Monadology.

I also like the music of Stereolab, and somewhat that of Latitia Sadier's
side project Monade, named apparently for a hypothetical psychological
mode of infants prior to differentiation of ego/superego/id. Though I 
don't know anything about Cornelius Castoriadisâ€™s "Psychic Monad," the
idea seems like a muddled western approach to Zen. Zen is a mode of pure
phenomenology, and is thus dominated by existential perspective.
